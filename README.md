#Image Manipulation Tool

This R Script takes a picture with more than 3 different kinds of colors. Then, it reduces the number of colors to 3 while preserving as much detail in the original image as possible.
The "elcapitan3.png" image is the input to my tool. The "output.png" image is the output my tool returns.

###How to run the program:
1. Download RStudio.
2. Open "Image Manipulation Tool Code.R" in RStudio.
3. Change line 3 to your computer's filepath to the project's folder.
4. Click on Line 1 of the Script.
5. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the tool.
6. Review "output.png".
